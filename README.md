In this repository I have uploaded my (C++) 2nd semester projects, the purpose of uploading these projects is that many students like me who are studying in colleges can understand the concept of C++ and those who are senior to me can check my code so that I can correct the mistakes and learn something new.

* Bank Management System:
  A comprehensive solution that leverages OOP principles to manage employee and manager data. Includes file handling for persistent storage and modular design for easy scalability.

* ATM Simulation System:
  A robust solution that utilizes exception handling to simulate real-world ATM operations. The system allows users to perform deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries while ensuring data integrity through error         
  management. With a modular design, the program is easy to extend and adaptable to different banking scenarios.
  Includes comprehensive error handling for invalid inputs and ensures smooth user interaction with a simple, text-based interface.
